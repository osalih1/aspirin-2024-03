The prescriptive approach was easier to follow since it breaks down the process step by step, making it more readable. However, the functional style was more concise and elegant, using higher-order functions to simplify the code. While prescriptive programming feels more natural to write, functional programming scales better with complex tasks and is easier to test due to fewer side effects. Overall, I prefer functional programming for its efficiency, but prescriptive is better for control and clarity in certain situations.
